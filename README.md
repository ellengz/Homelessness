# Homelessness

## Introduction
Our team was tasked with creating a video game targeting children from 7-10 to educate them about the causes, concerns, and responsibilities surrounding the issue of homelessness. The key requirements for this game were to be accessible and educational for children, and to link back to our clientâ€™s organisation (Salvation Army) with relevant information and content - all of the game design itself was our original work.

* Aiming at children from 7 to 10
* Web-based platform
* Having Salvation Army building in the game
* Not having any racial problem in the game
* Engaging and interesting
* Appropriate contents for children
* Extendable and maintainable
* Game response time should be very short

### Functional
* Customization and differentiate users

* Character dialogue can be added to Characters/Narrative.cs, following the system defined therein.
* Custom dialog ID hooks can be added to Characters/DialogueBox.cs including custom game logic.
* Common assets should be added to the Resources directory, so they can be dynamically loaded by all scenes.
